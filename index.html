        <p>You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away</p>
        <p>You tell me to come over, there's some games you want to play</p>
        <p>I'm walking to your house, nobody's home</p>
        <p>Just me and you and you and me alone</p><br>
        <p>We're just playing hide and seek</p>
        <p>It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you</p>
        <p>I don't want to play no games</p>
        <p>I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you</p><br>
        <p>I don't give a fuck about you anyways</p>
        <p>Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?</p>
        <p>You never share your toys or communicate</p>
        <p>I guess I'm just a play date to you</p><br>
        <p>Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say</p>
        <p>When I try to talk you're always playing board games</p>
        <p>I wish I had monopoly over your mind</p>
        <p>I wish I didn't care all the time</p>
